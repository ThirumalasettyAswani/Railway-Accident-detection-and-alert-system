# Railway-Accident-detection-and-alert-system
The document is about a railway safety and automation system using IoT and embedded systems to prevent accidents and improve efficiency. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

**PROJECT SUMMARY **
The project aims to enhance railway safety by detecting cracks in tracks, avoiding collisions, and managing railway crossings automatically. It also provides a smart crowd management system for train coaches.

**Key Components**
Embedded Systems: Utilizes microcontrollers (like NodeMCU ESP8266) for automation.
IoT (Internet of Things): Enables real-time data collection and alerts via sensors.
Sensors Used:
IR Sensors: Detect track cracks and obstacles.
Ultrasonic Sensors: Measure distances and detect objects.
Motion Sensors: Detect unauthorized movements.
Buzzer System: Provides alerts for emergencies.
DC Motors: Used for automatic gate control.
Software Implementation: Uses Arduino IDE for programming and cloud services like ThingSpeak for remote monitoring.
**Key Functionalities**
Crack Detection: Identifies cracks in tracks using IR and ultrasonic sensors.
Collision Avoidance: Automatically applies brakes if an obstacle is detected.
Automated Gate Control: Opens and closes railway gates automatically.
Drowsiness Detection: Monitors train driversâ€™ eye movements to prevent accidents.
Crowd Management: Notifies commuters about the occupancy of train coaches.
Live Train Tracking: Uses GPS and GSM modules for real-time monitoring.
**Future Scope**
Integration of AI for predictive maintenance.
Use of drones for aerial surveillance of tracks.
Enhanced automation with improved communication networks.
